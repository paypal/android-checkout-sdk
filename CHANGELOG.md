## Version 0.6.1

###  Required Proguard Rules for 0.6.1
```
-keepclassmembers class * extends com.google.crypto.tink.shaded.protobuf.GeneratedMessageLite {
  <fields>;
}
```
There's an issue with EncryptedSharedPreferences where the library is missing a required proguard rule. The temporary fix is to include the above rule in your app module's `proguard-rules.pro` file. Future versions of the SDK will automatically include this rule.
