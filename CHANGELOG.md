* Added ability to customize the cancellation dialog shown to users

```kotlin

    )
)
```

## Version 0.6.1
* Added support for v2/vault web fallback
* Resolves a navigation issue specific to Android 6
* Animation updates

###  Required Proguard Rules for 0.6.1
```
-keepclassmembers class * extends com.google.crypto.tink.shaded.protobuf.GeneratedMessageLite {
  <fields>;
}
```
There's an issue with EncryptedSharedPreferences where the library is missing a required proguard rule. The temporary fix is to include the above rule in your app module's `proguard-rules.pro` file. Future versions of the SDK will automatically include this rule.

## Version 0.6.0
* SDK now targets Android 12 version (API 31) as well as Java 11.
* Resolved a crash that happens when the app gets destroyed and then re-created by Android OS due to a config change.
